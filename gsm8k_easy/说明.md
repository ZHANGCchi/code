# 第一步

`gsm8k_base_inferance/filtered_pass@10_equals_1.csv`& `gsm8k_math_inferance/filtered_pass@10_equals_1.csv` --输入--> `PROCESS3.py` --输出--> `easy_train_pass@10_equals_1.csv`

得到去除了short模型和base模型交集的short模型的pass@10数据 **作为easy数据集的index检索**

# 第二步

`easy_train_pass@10_equals_1.csv`& `../gsm8k_math_inferance/infer_log.txt` --输入--> `PROCESS2.py` --输出--> `multi_answers_per_sample_for_easy_train.csv`

**过滤short模型的输出infer_log.txt，作为easy数据集的csv格式**

# 第三步

 `multi_answers_per_sample_for_easy_train.csv` --输入--> `CSV_to_JSONL.py` --输出--> `gsm8k_easy_data.jsonl`

{"gsm8k_index": 1, "question": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\nuser\nWeng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "answer": "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the babysitting time from minutes to hours.\n2. Calculate the earnings based on the hourly wage.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 50 minutes is equivalent to:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Weng earns $12 per hour. So, to find out how much she earned for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) hours, we multiply her hourly wage by \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\):\n\\[\n12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars."}
