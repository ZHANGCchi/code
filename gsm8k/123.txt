Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
assistant
To determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of clips sold in April.
2. Calculate the number of clips sold in May.
3. Add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total.

First, we know that Natalia sold 48 clips in April. 

Next, we need to find out how many clips she sold in May. According to the problem, she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Therefore, we calculate the number of clips sold in May as follows:
\[
\text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
\]

Now, we add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total number of clips sold:
\[
\text{Total clips sold} = \text{Clips sold in April} + \text{Clips sold in May} = 48 + 24 = 72
\]

Thus, the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May is \boxed{72}.

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
assistant
To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the babysitting time from minutes to hours.
2. Calculate the earnings based on the hourly wage.

First, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 50 minutes is equivalent to:
\[
\frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we know that Weng earns $12 per hour. So, to find out how much she earned for \(\frac{5}{6}\) hours, we multiply her hourly wage by \(\frac{5}{6}\):
\[
12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 12 \times 0.8333 = 10
\]

Thus, Weng earned \(\boxed{10}\) dollars.

1. **Calculate the amount of money Betty currently has:**
   - The wallet costs $100.
   - Betty has half of the money she needs.
   \[
   \text{Betty's current money} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Betty's parents give her:**
   - Her parents give her $15.

3. **Determine the amount of money Betty's grandparents give her:**
   - Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents.
   \[
   \text{Grandparents' money} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Betty receives from her parents and grandparents:**
   \[
   \text{Total money from parents and grandparents} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ dollars}

   James writes a 3-page letter to each of his 2 friends. Therefore, each time he writes letters, he writes:
   \[
   3 \text{ pages/letter} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 6 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pages James writes each week:**
   James writes letters twice a week. Therefore, each week he writes:
   \[
   6 \text{ pages/time} \times 2 \text{ times/week} = 12 \text{ pages/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pages James writes in a year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, in a year he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pages James writes in a year is \(\boxed{624}\).

Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
assistant
To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the items for which she has receipts.
2. Subtract this total from her initial budget to find out how much she spent on the shoes.

First, let's sum up the amounts spent on the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt:
\[
30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
30 + 46 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 38 = 114
\]
\[
114 + 11 = 125
\]
\[
125 + 18 = 143
\]

So, Alexis spent $143 on the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt. She has $16 left from her initial budget of $200. Therefore, the amount she spent on the shoes is:
\[
200 - 143 - 16 = 200 - 159 = 41
\]

Thus, Alexis paid \(\boxed{41}\) dollars for the shoes.

Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
assistant
To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings for both regular hours and overtime hours. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the regular and overtime hours per day:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.
   - Regular hours per day: 8 hours.
   - Overtime hours per day: \(10 - 8 = 2\) hours.

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Regular hourly wage: $18.00.
   - Overtime hourly wage: \(18.00 + \frac{1}{2} \times 18.00 = 18.00 + 9.00 = 27.00\).

   Now, calculate the total earnings for one day:
   - Earnings from regular hours: \(8 \times 18.00 = 144.00\).
   - Earnings from overtime hours: \(2 \times 27.00 = 54.00\).
   - Total daily earnings: \(144.00 + 54.00 = 198.00\).

3. **Calculate the total earnings for 5 days:**
   - Total weekly earnings: \(5 \times 198.00 = 990.00\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tina makes in 5 days is \(\boxed{990}\).

A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?
assistant
To determine the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to set up an equation based on the information given about the number of people on each ship over three hundred years. Let's denote the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years as \( x \).

According to the problem, each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Therefore, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the second hundred years is \( 2x \), and the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the third hundred years is \( 4x \).

The total number of people consumed over three hundred years is the sum of the people on the three ships:
\[ x + 2x + 4x = 847 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7x = 847 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ x = \frac{847}{7} = 121 \]

Thus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is \(\boxed{121}\).

Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?
assistant
Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Tobias has saved over the past three months. He receives a $5 allowance each month, so over three months, his allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Tobias mows 4 lawns and charges $15 for each lawn. So, the total amount of money he earns from mowing lawns is:
\[ 4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's say Tobias shovels \( d \) driveways. Since he charges $7 for each driveway, the total amount of money he earns from shoveling driveways is:
\[ 7d \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money Tobias has saved is the sum of his allowance, the money he earns from mowing lawns, and the money he earns from shoveling driveways:
\[ 15 + 60 + 7d = 75 + 7d \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change. The cost of the shoes is $95, so the amount of money he has left after buying the shoes is:
\[ 75 + 7d - 95 = 7d - 20 \text{ dollars} \]

We know that after buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 7d - 20 = 15 \]

To find \( d \), we solve the equation by first adding 20 to both sides:
\[ 7d = 35 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ d = 5 \]

So, Tobias shoveled \(\boxed{5}\) driveways.

Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?
assistant
To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to find out how many coconut trees he has and then add that to the number of mango trees.

First, let's find out how many coconut trees Randy has. According to the problem, Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. Since Randy has 60 mango trees, we start by calculating half of the number of mango trees:
\[
\frac{60}{2} = 30
\]
Next, we subtract 5 from this result to find the number of coconut trees:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]
So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.

Now, we add the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees to find the total number of trees on his farm:
\[
60 + 25 = 85
\]
Therefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is \boxed{85}.

assistant
To determine the total cost of the ingredients Jasper buys for his charcuterie, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cheddar Cheese:**
   Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. Therefore, the cost of the cheddar cheese is $10.

2. **Cream Cheese:**
   The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cost of the cream cheese is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cold Cuts:**
   The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cost of the cold cuts is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
10 + 5 + 20 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Jasper spends on the ingredients is \(\boxed{35}\).

Joy can read 8 pages of a book in 20 minutes. How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?
assistant
To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we start by finding her reading rate in pages per minute. We know that Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. Therefore, her reading rate is:

\[
\text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ pages per minute}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time required for Joy to read 120 pages. Using her reading rate, we set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{0.4 \text{ pages per minute}} = 120 \div 0.4 = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take Joy \boxed{5} hours to read 120 pages.

The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
assistant
To determine how much Mike will have after spending some of his share on a shirt, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total profit:**
   - Johnson's share is $2500.
   - The ratio of Mike's share to Johnson's share is 2:5.
   - Let \( M \) be Mike's share and \( J \) be Johnson's share.
   - According to the ratio, \( M(J) = 2 \). Given \( J = 2500 \), we substitute this value into the ratio:
     \[
     \frac{M}{2500} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides by 2500:
     \[
     M = 2500 \times \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Simplify the multiplication:
     \[
     M = 2500 \times 0.4 = 1000
     \]
   - Therefore, Mike's share is $1000.

2. **Determine how much Mike has left after spending on the shirt:**
   - Mike spends $200 on a shirt.
   - Subtract the cost of the shirt from Mike's share:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 1000 - 200 = 800
     \]

Thus, after spending some of his share on a shirt, Mike will have \(\boxed{800}\).

   - Remaining pink hard hats after John takes his: \( 22 - 6 = 16 \)
   - John also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed.
   - Number of green hard hats John takes away: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \)
   - Remaining green hard hats after John takes his: \( 15 - 12 = 3 \)

4. **Remaining Yellow Hard Hats:**
   - John does not take away any yellow hard hats.
   - Remaining yellow hard hats: 24

5. **Total Number of Hard Hats Remaining:**
   - Sum of remaining pink, green, and yellow hard hats: \( 16 + 3 + 24 = 43 \)

Thus, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is \(\boxed{43}\).

It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?
assistant
To determine the total number of hours Roque takes to get to and from work in a week, we need to break down his weekly schedule and calculate the time spent for each mode of transportation separately.

First, let's calculate the time Roque spends walking to and from work each day:
- Roque walks to work in 2 hours.
- Roque walks back home in 2 hours.
- Total time spent walking each day: \(2 + 2 = 4\) hours.

 Roque walks to and from work three times a week:
- Total time spent walking in a week: \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 12\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the time Roque spends biking to and from work each day:
- Roque rides his bike to work in 1 hour.
- Roque rides his bike back home in 1 hour.
- Total time spent biking each day: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Roque rides his bike to and from work twice a week:
- Total time spent biking in a week: \(2 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 4\) hours.

Finally, we add the total time spent walking and the total time spent biking to find the total time spent getting to and from work in a week:
- Total time spent getting to and from work in a week: \(12 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 16\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Roque takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking is \(\boxed{16}\).

Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?
assistant
To determine how much time Tim spends biking in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he bikes and then divide that by his biking speed.

First, let's calculate the distance Tim bikes to and from work each day. Since his work is 20 miles away, the round trip distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out the total distance he bikes to and from work over the 5 workdays:
\[ 40 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distance he bikes on his weekend ride:
\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 200 \text{ miles} = 400 \text{ miles} \]

Since Tim bikes at a speed of 25 miles per hour, we can find the total time he spends biking by dividing the total distance by his speed:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ mph}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time Tim spends biking in a week is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]

Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?
assistant
To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

First, we know that Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.
\[ \text{Snowflake stamps} = 11 \]

Next, we are told that Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
\[ \text{Truck stamps} = 11 + 9 = 20 \]

Then, we are told that Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
\[ \text{Rose stamps} = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

To find the total number of stamps Bella bought, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps together:
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Bella bought is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?
assistant
To determine the total number of beetles eaten each day in the forest, we need to follow the chain of consumption step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of snakes eaten by the jaguars:**
   - There are 6 jaguars.
   - Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.
   \[
   6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of birds eaten by the snakes:**
   - There are 30 snakes.
   - Each snake eats 3 birds per day.
   \[
   30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the birds:**
   - There are 90 birds.
   - Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.
   \[
   90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten each day in the forest is \(\boxed{1080}\).

Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
assistant
To determine the number of letters in Samantha's last name, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of Jamie's last name:**
   Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey.
   - Jamie's last name is "Grey".
   - The length of "Grey" is 4 letters.

2. **Determine the length of Bobbie's last name after removing two letters:**
   Bobbie took two letters off her last name, and the resulting last name is twice the length of Jamie's last name.
   - Twice the length of Jamie's last name is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) letters.
   - Therefore, the length of Bobbie's last name after removing two letters is 8 letters.

3. **Determine the original length of Bobbie's last name:**
   Bobbie removed 2 letters from her last name to get 8 letters.
   - Let \( x \) be the original length of Bobbie's last name.
   - We have the equation \( x - 2 = 8 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 8 + 2 = 10 \).

4. **Determine the length of Samantha's last name:**
   Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.
   - Bobbie's last name has 10 letters.
   - Therefore, Samantha's last name has \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) letters.

Thus, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is \(\boxed{7}\).

Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?
assistant
To determine the cost of each top, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the shorts.
2. Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
3. Subtract the total cost of the shorts and shoes from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the tops.
4. Divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost of each top.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. The total cost of the shorts is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pairs} \times \$7 \text{ per pair} = \$35
   \]

2. The total cost of the shoes is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pairs} \times \$10 \text{ per pair} = \$20
   \]

3. The total cost of the shorts and shoes together is:
   \[
   \$35 + \$20 = \$55
   \]

4. The total amount spent on the tops is:
   \[
   \$75 - \$55 = \$20
   \]

5. The cost of each top is:
   \[
   \frac{\$20}{4 \text{ tops}} = \$5 \text{ per top}
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each top is \(\boxed{5}\).

Mary does her grocery shopping on Saturday. She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?
assistant
To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we start by noting the initial credit limit and the amounts she has already paid.

1. **Initial Credit Limit:**
   Mary has a credit limit of $100.

2. **Amount Spent:**
   Mary spent the full credit limit, which is $100.

3. ** amounts Paid:**
   - On Tuesday, Mary paid $15.
   - On Thursday, Mary paid $23.

4. **Total Payments Made:**
   To find the total amount Mary has paid, we add the amounts she paid on Tuesday and Thursday:
   \[
   15 + 23 = 38
   \]

5. **Remaining Credit to Pay:**
   To find out how much credit Mary still needs to pay, we subtract the total payments made from the initial credit limit:
   \[
   100 - 38 = 62
   \]

Therefore, Mary needs to pay \(\boxed{62}\) dollars before her next shopping trip.

Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?
assistant
To determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he hit and subtract that from the total number of balls.

First, we calculate the number of balls Ralph hit out of the first 100 balls:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]
So, Ralph hit 40 balls out of the first 100.

Next, we calculate the number of balls Ralph hit out of the next 75 balls:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25
\]
So, Ralph hit 25 balls out of the next 75.

Now, we add the number of balls he hit from both sets to find the total number of balls he hit:
\[
40 + 25 = 65
\]
So, Ralph hit a total of 65 balls.

Finally, we subtract the number of balls he hit from the total number of balls to find out how many he did not hit:
\[
175 - 65 = 110
\]
Therefore, the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is \(\boxed{110}\).
